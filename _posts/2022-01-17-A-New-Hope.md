There has been a substanial amount of recovery since my last post. I have received adequate help for my mental health and improved my physical health as well. I have read a good number of books and seen a fair amount of movies. I met someone special within the last year. I want to build a future for not just me, but also with her. I started a part-time job to get myself back to work! I'm studying and reviewing to ease my anxiety with being able to return to my career. I hope that someone takes a chance on me as I am now taking a chance on myself. I know my worth and how much I can bring to any company or business. The world is my oyster and I'm ready to find my place.
